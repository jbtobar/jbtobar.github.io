## Consulting Work:

 - Full-stack blockchain engineer for Krypton Moscow

I was hired for my smart contract (Solidity) expertise to build contracts to be used for responsible fundraising including cyclical-fund-release and digital arbitration that would secure and be relied on by millions of dollars around the world.

Impressed by my skills and delivery - Krypton management asked me to not only do the contracts but to redesign the entire back-end infrastructure. My abilities meant the company did not have to hire a third party agency to build the backend API and documentation - saving them thousands of dollars.

 - Smart Contract Testing for Array.io

Continued to be impressed by my skills, the Krypton management asked me for yet another role. I was hired to do one of the most critical roles in a more ambitious project - smart contract testing for a blockchain project that promised to disrupt the ecosystem. I was responsible for making sure the most critical code of the system would not fail.

## Notable Requests:


- IBM

Upon my return to Ecuador, the IBM team heard about my skills and asked me to their office. They needed someone with my abilities because there is no one in the country who can implement blockchain technology. This means they have to fly in foreign engineers - with the language and logistics issues - to implement their products. Hiring me would save them thousands of dollars.

After learning about my products and company and understanding my commitment to my company - they were so impressed that they gave me a 120k incentive to support their technology in my products.

 - BP (Largest bank in Ecuador)

Upon my return to Ecuador, the CEO of the largest bank in the country invited me to have a one-on-one session on how blockchain works and how it will disrupt the financial industry.
