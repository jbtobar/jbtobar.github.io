I am the founder of ADOM Inc. - a technology company. We leverage blockchain technology to make people's lives easier. 

I created and developed the first app that allows you to paste and interact with blockchain smart contracts directly on a chat conversation - MAIA-X - an app that allows anyone in the world with a smartphone and internet connection to have full financial access. It is designed to be intuitive so as to be used by any person, and lightweight so that it can be accessible for any smartphone.

I invented the MAIA Blockchain Card - a physical card that can be used in replacement of Debit/Credit/Bank Cards for money transfer, and in replacement of identification cards. It is connected to the blockchain via the MAIA-X app. This means merchants can begin accepting digital payments simply by downloading MAIA-X. This card can also revolutionize the ticketing and identification industry as a user can use it to authenticate with any smart contract in the blockchain.

Combined they form the first-ever Blockchain Mobile Toolkit. A Toolkit with the potential of harnessing the power of blockchain technology to revolutionize the way we interact with each other around the world.

I believe in what I call the "New Financial Paradigm". It is what happens to finance once blockchain technology becomes mainstream. It parallels what happened to information when the internet became mainstream. I aim to help build the new financial paradigm with my products.

(You may request a MAIA Blockchain Card via the app)

I am currently seeking funding.

## Projects

### ADOM Inc.

ADOM Inc. is a technology company focused on bringing blockchain technology to the masses by building simple and intuitive products. The company features 3 products: MAIA-X, Daployer, and Dalia. The ADOM Inc. ecosystem - featuring the MAIA-X mobile app - allows anyone with a smartphone to have full financial access and connection to smart contracts and blockchain technology. This is very impacting as enables low-cost money services such as international money transfers, debt, credit, among others. ADOM Inc. is my creation, from the idea to the incorporation to the design and coding of all its products - I am the founder and owner - it is a C-Corp incorporated in 2018 in Delaware.

### MAIA-X

A mobile app designed for mass consumption that allows anyone with a smartphone to interact with the blockchain. It is designed as a chat+wallet app, allowing users to have conversations surrounding the smart contracts and transactions they interact with. The immediate implications of this include low-cost international money transfers, low cost POS activity, low-cost debt and other financial services.

MAIA-X has undergone beta testing and is in review by the Apple App Store. Upon approval it would be the first of its kind.

I built this app from idea to the design to the code.

### Daployer

A web program geared to facilitate the design and testing of smart contracts by providing a simple interface. It allows both technical and non-technical users to tinker and develop with the blockchain.

In my previous work developing smart contracts for the firm Krypton it became clear to me that there was no platform that would allow technical developers to test their contracts alongside the non-technical side of the team. It has a couple of features that make the blockchain developer's life a little easier.

I built this tool it is available open-source at npm.org

More information at [daployer.maia.live/api/ui](https://daployer.maia.live/api/ui)


### DALIA

Dalia is an independent and private implementation of the Ethereum blockchain. It is identical to the Ethereum blockchain except that ADOM has power of authority. It is designed for private use within the MAIA-X ecosystem and as an alternative to people who wish to use a zero-cost blockchain.

The Ethereum blockchain attempts to be public and trustless. The price of that is paid by the users who have to pay fees to transact in the blockchain. 

The DALIA alternative means you can transact for free, but it is not decentralized. As ADOM aims for the highest standards, we believe our clients will trust us.

I setup, implemented, and now run this version of the blockchain.

It is accessible via RPC at [blocks.maia.live](http://blocks.maia.live/)


### Fundraising Contracts with Digital Arbitration

I designed and built smart contracts that allow a project to raise money in stages and resolve disputes between investors and the company via a process of digital arbitration.

This means that an entrepreneur anywhere in the world - a coffeemaker in Ecuador - could raise money from anyone else in the world to open another coffee shop, and the lenders would be protected because the money would only be given to the coffeemaker if certain criteria is met. Any lender can dispute whether the criteria is met and a pool or arbiters capacitated to resolve would be chosen at random to vote.

I was given the technical specifications and I built the contracts.


## Academia
