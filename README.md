# Juan Bernardo Tobar


Bringing to life products that leverage blockchain technology to make peoples lives easier - Blockchain Engineer and Founder at ADOM Inc.

[MAIA-X - beta is out on TestFlight!](https://testflight.apple.com/join/7T4BxfEm)



## Work

### ADOM Inc.

ADOM Inc. is a technology company focused on bringing blockchain technology to the masses by building simple and intuitive products. The company features 3 products: MAIA-X, Daployer, and Dalia. The ADOM Inc. ecosystem - featuring the MAIA-X mobile app - allows anyone with a smartphone to have full financial access and connection to smart contracts and blockchain technology. This is very impacting as enables low-cost money services such as international money transfers, debt, credit, among others. ADOM Inc. is my creation, from the idea to the incorporation to the design and coding of all its products - I am the founder and owner - it is a C-Corp incorporated in 2018 in Delaware.

### MAIA-X

A mobile app designed for mass consumption that allows anyone with a smartphone to interact with the blockchain. It is designed as a chat+wallet app, allowing users to have conversations surrounding the smart contracts and transactions they interact with. The immediate implications of this include low-cost international money transfers, low cost POS activity, low-cost debt and other financial services.

MAIA-X has undergone beta testing and is in review by the Apple App Store. Upon approval it would be the first of its kind.

I built this app from idea to the design to the code.

### Daployer

A web program geared to facilitate the design and testing of smart contracts by providing a simple interface. It allows both technical and non-technical users to tinker and develop with the blockchain.

In my previous work developing smart contracts for the firm Krypton it became clear to me that there was no platform that would allow technical developers to test their contracts alongside the non-technical side of the team. It has a couple of features that make the blockchain developer's life a little easier.

I built this tool it is available open-source at npm.org

### DALIA

Dalia is an independent and private implementation of the Ethereum blockchain. It is identical to the Ethereum blockchain except that ADOM has power of authority. It is designed for private use within the MAIA-X ecosystem and as an alternative to people who wish to use a zero-cost blockchain.

The Ethereum blockchain attempts to be public and trustless. The price of that is paid by the users who have to pay fees to transact in the blockchain. 

The DALIA alternative means you can transact for free, but it is not decentralized. As ADOM aims for the highest standards, we believe our clients will trust us.

I setup, implemented, and now run this version of the blockchain.

It is accessible via RPC at [blocks.maia.live](http://blocks.maia.live/)


### Krypton

Krypton is one of the leading incubator firms focusing on blockchain technology. 

For them I designed smart contracts that allow a project to raise money in stages and resolve disputes between investors and the company via a process of digital arbitration.

This means that an entrepreneur anywhere in the world - a coffeemaker in Ecuador - could raise money from anyone else in the world to open another coffee shop, and the lenders would be protected because the money would only be given to the coffeemaker if certain criteria is met. Any lender can dispute whether the criteria is met and a pool or arbiters capacitated to resolve would be chosen at random to vote.

I was given the technical specifications and I built the contracts.


## Academia

### B.A - University of Rochester - 2014

I graduated with a B.A from the University of Rochester in NY with a double major in Philosophy and Economics. My achievements there include highest distinction in philosophy, an honors thesis in Economics, and my work as the Head of the Production Department at WRUR 88.5.

Honors Thesis: A mathematical model of the petrodollar and Russia's alternative
Highest Distinction in Philosophy

### M.Sc in Software Engineering - HSE - 2018

I recieved a Master's in Science diploma from Higher School of Economics in Moscow under a full-ride scholarship by one of the leading universities in computer science. My thesis focusing on blockchain technology was awarded the first place upon graduation.

Full scholarship
Thesis: An Options Trading Platform with a Blockchain Backend
